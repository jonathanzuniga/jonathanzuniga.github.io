I am a front-end developer with experience using  

Before being exposed to the microprocessors, I had the intention of studying graphic design. However, doing things with bits and bytes is much more fun than with traditional materials. The interest I had in art gradually changed to web design/development. Approximately in the year 2000, I made my first website in the extinct Geocities and from there I made pages for entertainment until in 2004, with my site —before it was a blog— and others for various clients I have been involved in the wonderful and messy web world.

Some of the things I like are information freedom, hacker subculture, [retro-futuristic interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ywWFvjE-yU){:target='_blank'}, an internet that respects humans, [urban art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmu_RByhlGw){:target='_blank'}, dark chocolate, [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbxZmcQWWgE){:target='_blank'}, fruitcake, tea, and drawing letters, but not necessarily in this order. Most of [my projects](https://github.com/{{ author.github_username }}?tab=repositories){:target='_blank'} is open source and you can find them on GitHub. Thanks for reading, whoever you are. At this moment there are no comments, there are no accounts, there are no statistics. Only me and many blank text files to complete. We'll see how it goes this time.
