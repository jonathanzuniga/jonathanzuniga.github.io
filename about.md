I'm a front-end developer with experience creating modern web applications using research, wireframes, prototyping, user-testing, frameworks, and libraries that interact with third-party APIs and services to create simple and delightful experiences <!-- for a wide range of clients -->. I have done varied work, but mostly development for web and mobile applications, whenever I find some free time, I like to experiment with creative coding and immersive media, particularly virtual reality, as a tool to reveal new ways of viewing the world and express ourselves within it. <!-- to understand our world and express ourselves within it. -->

Before being exposed to the microprocessors, I had the intention of studying graphic design. However, doing things with bits and bytes is much more fun than with traditional materials. The interest I had in art gradually changed to web design/development. Approximately in the year 2000, I made my first website in the extinct Geocities and from there I made pages for entertainment until in 2004, with my site —before it was a blog— and others for a wide range of clients, I have been involved in the wonderful and messy world of web development.

Some of the things I like are information freedom, hacker subculture, [retro-futuristic interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ywWFvjE-yU){:target='_blank'}, an internet that respects humans, [urban art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmu_RByhlGw){:target='_blank'}, dark chocolate, [electronic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbxZmcQWWgE){:target='_blank'}, cryptography, tea, and drawing letters, but not necessarily in this order. Most of [my projects](https://github.com/{{ author.github_username }}?tab=repositories){:target='_blank'} is open source and you can find them on GitHub. Thank you for reading, whoever you are. At this moment there are no comments, there are no accounts, there are no statistics. Only me and many blank text files to complete. We'll see how it goes this time.
